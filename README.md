MY TOKEN SMART CONTRACT
Overview
MyToken is a simple Ethereum-based smart contract that implements a basic token system. The contract allows the owner to mint and burn tokens. Each minted token increases the total supply, and each burned token decreases the total supply. The contract also provides transparency by emitting events for minting and burning actions.

Features
Token Name: Raman
Token Abbreviation: ETH
Total Supply: The total number of tokens in circulation.
Balances: A mapping that keeps track of each address's token balance.
Functions
mint(address _address, uint256 _value)
Description: Mints new tokens to the specified address.
Parameters:
_address: The address to which the tokens will be minted.
_value: The number of tokens to be minted.
Effects: Increases both the totalSupply and the balance of the specified address.
Event Emitted: Mint(address indexed to, uint256 value)
burn(address _address, uint256 _value)
Description: Burns tokens from the specified address.
Parameters:
_address: The address from which the tokens will be burned.
_value: The number of tokens to be burned.
Effects: Decreases both the totalSupply and the balance of the specified address.
Event Emitted: Burn(address indexed from, uint256 value)
Requirement: The balance of the address must be greater than or equal to the _value.
Events
Mint(address indexed to, uint256 value): Emitted when new tokens are minted.
Burn(address indexed from, uint256 value): Emitted when tokens are burned.
Example Usage
Minting Tokens:
Call the mint function with the desired address and token amount.
Example: mint(0x123..., 1000);
Burning Tokens:
Call the burn function with the desired address and token amount.
Example: burn(0x123..., 500);
Deployment
To deploy the contract:

Ensure you have the Solidity compiler (solc) version 0.8.18 installed.
Compile the contract using Remix or a local development environment like Hardhat or Truffle.
Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum network.
Considerations
The contract allows any address to call mint and burn, which means it doesn't restrict these operations to a specific role. If you require more control, consider implementing an ownership or role-based access control mechanism.
No safemath library is used, as Solidity version 0.8.0 and above includes built-in overflow checks.
